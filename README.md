# YouTubeDataAPI

I used the YouTube Data API to fetch the liked videos from my account and derived two results I wanted to see. Note that the following result is only from the last 1000 liked videos, as of 10th July 2019. Although I have more than 3000 liked videos I couldn't fetch them all because YouTube doesn't allow one to retrieve more than 1000 results.

First, I plotted the number of videos I have liked in various YouTube categories. There are around 32 categories, I haven't plotted the ones in which no video has been watched.

Second, I plotted the number of videos I have liked from various YouTube channels. I have only plotted the result for the channels in which I had watched more than 5 videos to avoid cluttering.
